	The attitude and orbit control is one of the most critical technology of any spatial [31msystems \cite{wertz1978spacecraft},[m[32msystem,[m the main actuators include propellants, magnetic torques and reaction wheels. Reaction wheels are hard to replace because they present a large operating range in torque (unlike magnetic actuators) and are powered by renewable energy provided by solar panels (unlike propellers based on a finite fuel supply). For these reasons, reaction wheels are present on virtually any satellite with[31ma[m minimum performance requirements in attitude.
	[m
	A reaction wheel can be described as an inertial actuator operating on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The[31mperformance of the[m reaction wheel [31mon[m[32mmodifies[m the[31msatellite takes place by exchange of[m angular [31mmomentum,[m[32mmomentum of the satellite,[m limited to the axis of rotation of the wheel. Due to the [31mlarge[m[32minertial[m difference between the satellite and the[31minertia of the[m reaction wheel, a control of attitude with [31mgreat,[m[32mhigh[m precision is possible with this system. 
	[m
	Reaction wheels typically consist of an electric motor, usually a DC brushless motor, a bearing system and one element of inertia. The inertia [31mmember[m[32mcomponent[m and the motor are mounted on bearings to ensure precise rotation about [31man[m[32mone[m axis. The rotation speed of the system is controlled by an electronic motor drive. Reaction wheels can be operated in two distinct ways: by rotation or torque.
	[m
	The suspension of the rotor relative to the stator is a critical part in the reaction wheels \citep{taniwaki2003experimental} [32mdue to[m the consequences of any friction [32mcan cause[m in the relative movement between these two components. Indeed, the friction is reflected  in [31ma greater[m[32mhigh[m consumption of electric power, introduction of a dead zone of operation in torque as well as limited life of the reaction wheel due to gradual wear of the bearing.
	[m
	A  mechanical solution for the interface between the rotor and the stator is a rolling bearing. Despite its apparent simplicity, [32mthe are[m challenges for achieving the minimum friction values needed in view of the demands of consumption and easiness of control \citep{Krishnan2010}.
	[31mIn the[m[32mThe[m case of aerospace applications, lubrication rolling [31mis also difficulty due[m[32mhas problems because[m to the impossibility of using traditional lubricants under conditions of low or no air pressure, [31mwhich leads[m[32mdue[m to [32mthe[m loss of volatile components (lubricants) and their consequent deterioration. Another difficulty is [31mdue to the[m[32mmigration's[m trend of[31mmigration of[m lubricants in the absence of gravity, which is usually addressed with strategies to recapture or relubrication.
	[m
	Another solution is [31mto use[m[32musing[m a magnetic bearing [31m\citep{Bangcheng2012},[m[32m\citep{Bangcheng2012, bleuler2009magnetic},[m which is an alternative without mechanical contact between the rotor and the stator. The gain in reliability and lifetime of the reaction wheel is considerable \citep{Marble2006}, and basically limited by the durability of electronics. The non-contact operation eliminates the need [31mfor[m[32mof[m lubrication and consequently enables the operation under [31mvacuum[m[32mvacuum,[m which results in [31msimplifying[m[32msimple[m the mechanical design requirements.

The rotor has [32ma[m "I" cross shape and it is surrounded by the external and internal stator[31mwith[m  both [32mwith[m "C" cross shape. The internal [31mstator[m[32mstator, which[m is used for active control [32mof[m radial directions [32mand[m has four independent poles to generate [31mflux[m[32mflux,[m which also contributes to increase the axial stiffness of the rotor. Passive degrees of freedoms are stabilized by the magnetic flux generated by the permanent magnet.

	Another magnetic bearing [31mproposition\citep{Scharfe2001}[m[32mproposition \citep{Scharfe2001}[m also works with the radial direction [31mcontrolled, it[m[32mcontrolled. It[m has only one stator that is located at the center of the bearing and one external rotor, both parts [31mhave[m[32mhaving[m a "C" cross shape. The permanent magnetic poles are located on the rotor generating a magnetic flux that stabilizes the axial [31mdirection, this[m[32mdirection. This[m topology allows generating a subtractive magnetic flux in some parts of the rotor in favor of [31mdecrease[m[32mdecreasing[m the attraction force and places the rotor at the operation point with less effort.

	The magnetic bearing proposed in this work is inspired on the topologies by \cite{Bernus1998} and \cite{Scharfe2001}. The bearing has [31mfour[m[32mthree[m degrees of freedom passively stable: tilt,[31mrow,[m pitch and its axial [31mdirection, the[m[32mdirection. The[m other[31mtwo[m degrees of freedom (radial) are actively stabilized. Torque imposed for the rotation of the rotor is developed by an electric[31mmotor[m brushless DC (BLDC) [32mmotor[m placed inside the bearing. The magnetic circuit comprises two stators: one outer rotor and [31mother[m[32mone[m inner [32mbearing[m rotor. The first one is responsible for stabilization of passives degrees of freedom and the inner one to control the rotor radial position through eight magnetic poles.% Was decided to install the permanent magnets in the external stator not in the rotor as seen in the literature, seeking to the best mechanical balance of the rotor. 
	 Figure \ref{fig:mancal:corte} is a cut of the proposed bearing. We adopted a flat geometry to better stiffness in the unstable modes of the bearing. The outboard bearing to the motor enables a stiffness within the proposed limits of mass and dimensions.

	Two different forces [31macts[m[32mact[m on the rotor: the  non-conservative forces ($Q^{nc}$) caused by the force applied by the actuators ($F_b$) that are depended on the rotor position and on the applied current ($i$); Conservative ($Q^{c}$) forces (which depend only on the position of the rotor) resulted from the passive attraction force ($K_p$). Both $F_b$ and $K_p$ are [31mraised[m[32mgot[m from the calculated force by finite element model, respectively shown on Fig. \ref{fig:forca:ativo} and Fig. \ref{fig:forca:passivo:fx}.
