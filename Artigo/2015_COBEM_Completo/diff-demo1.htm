On this simulation the controller is initially disabled and a no zero initial condition takes the rotor from the equilibrium position to at it maximum excursion ($dy = 0.35 mm and dx = 0.18 mm$). The controller is activated at 0.1 second and takes 0.3 seconds to recover the rotor from the worst case to its nominal position. A disturbance of 0.01 mm is applied to dx position at 0.5 seconds. Max current peak occurs when controlled is activated and wont exceeds 0.5 A.</td>

The estimator is than dependent of applied current ($I$) , air gap length ($l_g$) and area ($S_g$). By the magnetic attraction force ($F$), we can derive the equation that correlates a current by de desired force.</td>

Future work are in line to have a more complete electromagnetic model aiming the execution of more optimizations on the proposed topology. A first functional prototype with position sensors and drive electronics will help to push the development of others subsystems of the reaction wheel.</td>

        <td class="modified">	In this paper, we proposed a new topology to a magnetic bearing system to a satellite reaction wheel. This bearing works radially active controlled by an eight electromagnets that exercises attraction force on the rotor. The passives degrees of freedom are stabilized due to a magnetic placed on the external stator. Optimizations and simulations were performed in order to achieve a bearing which complies with the restrictions, by the force models we project a dynamic model that represent the instable bearing part. A robust loopshaping controller is proposed to stabilize the rotor at it operation point, with little oscillation.</td>
