abstract = {The satellite reaction wheel's configuration plays also an important role in providing the attitude control torques. Several configurations based on three or four reaction wheels are investigated in order to identify the most suitable orientation that consumes a minimum power. Such information in a coherent form is not summarized in any publication; and therefore, an extensive literature search is required to obtain these results. In addition, most of the available results are from different test conditions; hence, making them difficult for comparison purposes. In this work, the standard reaction wheel control and angular momentum unloading schemes are adopted for all the reaction wheel configurations. The schemes will be presented together with their governing equations, making them fully amenable to numerical treatments. Numerical simulations are then performed for all the possible reaction wheel configurations with respect to an identical reference mission. All the configurations are analyzed in terms of their torques, momentums and attitude control performances. Based on the simulations, the reaction wheel configuration that has a minimum total control torque level is identified, which also corresponds to the configuration with minimum power consumption. ?? 2009 COSPAR.},

abstract = {This paper reports the design and analysis of a planar magnetic field concentrator with two gaps used for a resonant magnetic sensor and technology steps towards its realization. The device is based on a previously published resonant magnetic sensor combining a magnetic field concentrator and a mechanical resonator. A physical model is reported to explain the magnetic forces acting between the moveable inner part and the two fixed outer parts of the concentrator and the resulting magnetic field dependence of the resonance frequency. To optimize the concentrator and obtain highest sensitivity for the resonant sensor, three-dimensional magnetic finite element simulations using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICStrade were performed. For the fabrication of planar concentrators made of amorphous soft magnetic material, ion beam etching (IBE), aqua regia wet etching and laser cutting were tested and evaluated.},

@article{Ravaud2009,
abstract = {This paper deals with the calculation of the force and the stiffness between two ring permanent magnets whose polarization is axial. Such a configuration corresponds to a passive magnetic bearing. All the calculations are determined by using the Coulombian model. The paper also discusses the optimal ring dimensions that provide a large force or stiffness between the rings. Such properties are commonly sought in passive magnetic bearings. We propose a three-dimensional method for optimizing these parameters. An important result is established in this paper: the exact relative position of the rings for which the force is the strongest depends on the air gap dimension. As the expressions in this paper give this exact relative position, manufacturers can easily optimize their passive magnetic bearings. This result is new because the curvature effect is taken into account. Such semianalytical expressions are more precise than the numerical evaluation of the magnetic forces obtained with the finite-element method. In addition, semianalytical expressions have a low computational cost whereas the finite-element method is computation-intensive. Such calculations make it easy to optimize quadripolar lenses and other devices utilizing permanent magnets.},

@article{Balaban2009,
abstract = {Sensor faults continue to be a major hurdle for systems health management to reach its full potential. At the same time, few recorded instances of sensor faults exist. It is equally difficult to seed particular sensor faults. Therefore, research is underway to better understand the different fault modes seen in sensors and to model the faults. The fault models can then be used in simulated sensor fault scenarios to ensure that algorithms can distinguish between sensor faults and system faults. The paper illustrates the work with data collected from an electromechanical actuator in an aerospace setting, equipped with temperature, vibration, current, and position sensors. The most common sensor faults, such as bias, drift, scaling, and dropout were simulated and injected into the experimental data, with the goal of making these simulations as realistic as feasible. A neural network-based classifier was then created and tested on both experimental data and the more challenging randomized data sequences. Additional studies were also conducted to determine sensitivity of detection and disambiguation efficacy with respect to severity of fault conditions.},

@article{Johnson2001,
abstract = {This paper covers the technical aspects of an electromechanical
battery. A permanent magnet motor-generator is incorporated in a
composite flywheel, running at high speed in a vacuum containment to
minimize air friction losses. The flywheel is to be suspended on
cascaded, Teflon coated, high-speed roller bearings. A composite
flywheel requires a simple containment to sustain the vacuum for the
moving parts, since most of the energy is dissipated in the fracture
process in case of catastrophic failure. A three-phase, switch mode
bridge converter, driven by a bipolar pulse width modulation board,
achieves the variable speed control for the flywheel and the control of
the DC bus voltage. The target storage capacity is 250 Wh with a power
rating of 40 W},

@article{Cheng2011,
abstract = {In order to improve the performance of a magnetically levitated (maglev) axial flow blood pump, three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) was used to optimize the design of a hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB). Radial, axial, and current stiffness of multiple design variations of the HMB were calculated using a 3-D FEA package and verified by experimental results. As compared with the original design, the optimized HMB had twice the axial stiffness with the resulting increase of negative radial stiffness partially compensated for by increased current stiffness. Accordingly, the performance of the maglev axial flow blood pump with the optimized HMBs was improved: the maximum pump speed was increased from 6000 rpm to 9000 rpm (50\%). The radial, axial and current stiffness of the HMB was found to be linear at nominal operational position from both 3-D FEA and empirical measurements. Stiffness values determined by FEA and empirical measurements agreed well with one another. The magnetic flux density distribution and flux loop of the HMB were also visualized via 3-D FEA which confirms the designers' initial assumption about the function of this HMB. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@misc{Rycroft1992,
abstract = {This fourth edition of the bestselling Spacecraft Systems Engineering title provides the reader with comprehensive coverage of the design of spacecraft and the implementation of space missions, across a wide spectrum of space applications and space science. The text has been thoroughly revised and updated, with each chapter authored by a recognized expert in the field. Three chapters – Ground Segment, Product Assurance and Spacecraft System Engineering – have been rewritten, and the topic of Assembly, Integration and Verification has been introduced as a new chapter, filling a gap in previous editions.This edition addresses ‘front-end system-level issues’ such as environment, mission analysis and system engineering, but also progresses to a detailed examination of subsystem elements which represents the core of spacecraft design. This includes mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects, as well as propulsion and control. This quantitative treatment is supplemented by an emphasis on the interactions between elements, which deeply influences the process of spacecraft design.Adopted on courses worldwide, Spacecraft Systems Engineering is already widely respected by students, researchers and practising engineers in the space engineering sector. It provides a valuable resource for practitioners in a wide spectrum of disciplines, including system and subsystem engineers, spacecraft equipment designers, spacecraft operators, space scientists and those involved in related sectors such as space insurance.In summary, this is an outstanding resource for aerospace engineering students, and all those involved in the technical aspects of design and engineering in the space sector.},

abstract = {Various methods have been proposed in the past to realize
self-sensing or sensorless Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB's). In this
paper, the inductance-sensing method is discussed, its basics are
derived, and a test-signal injection method to implement this scheme is
presented. In order to identify and quantize the limiting factors
affecting the inductance measurement, a real AMB under working
conditions is simulated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) techniques.
By doing so, conditions are brought out for the successful
implementation of inductance-sensing schemes in AMB's. It is concluded
that the scheme proposed saves complicated and costly hard/softwares for
its implementation},

@article{Bitterly1998,
abstract = {This paper describes the present status of flywheel energy storage technology, or mechanical batteries, and discusses realistic future projections that are possible based on stronger composite materials and advancing technology. The origins and use of flywheel technology for mechanical energy storage began several hundred years ago and was developed throughout the Industrial Revolution. One of the first “modern” dissertations on the theoretical stress limitations of rotational disks (isotropic only) is the seminal work by Dr. A. Stodola [l] whose first translation to English was made in 1917. The next big milestones were during the 1960s and 1970s when NASA sponsored programs proposed energy storage flywheels as possible primary sources for space missions. However, it was not until the 1980’s when microelectronics, magnetic bearing systems and high power density motor-generators became enabling technologies. The next decade proved that a mechanical battery could surpass chemical batteries for many applications.},

@article{Bolund2007,
abstract = {For ages flywheels have been used to achieve smooth operation of machines. The early models where purely mechanical consisting of only a stone wheel attached to an axle. Nowadays flywheels are complex constructions where energy is stored mechanically and transferred to and from the flywheel by an integrated motor/generator. The stone wheel has been replaced by a steel or composite rotor and magnetic bearings have been introduced. Today flywheels are used as supplementary UPS storage at several industries world over. Future applications span a wide range including electric vehicles, intermediate storage for renewable energy generation and direct grid applications from power quality issues to offering an alternative to strengthening transmission. One of the key issues for viable flywheel construction is a high overall efficiency, hence a reduction of the total losses. By increasing the voltage, current losses are decreased and otherwise necessary transformer steps become redundant. So far flywheels over 10kV have not been constructed, mainly due to isolation problems associated with high voltage, but also because of limitations in the power electronics. Recent progress in semi-conductor technology enables faster switching and lower costs. The predominant part of prior studies have been directed towards optimising mechanical issues whereas the electro technical part now seem to show great potential for improvement. An overview of flywheel technology and previous projects are presented and moreover a 200kW flywheel using high voltage technology is simulated.},

@article{Aeronautics,
abstract = {A general procedure for the design and analysis of three-axis, large-angle attitude control systems has been developed. Properties of three-dimensional rotations are used to formulate a model of such systems. The model is general in that it is based on those properties which are common to all attitude control systems, rather than on special properties of particular components. Numerical values are assigned to attitude error by means of error functions. These functions are used to construct asymptotically stable control laws. The overall (global) behavior of the system is characterized by the envelope of all time histories of attitude error generated by every possible combination of initial condition, target attitude motion, and disturbance. A method for computing upper bounds on the response envelope is presented. Applications of this method indicate that it provides a useful alternative to Liapunov analysis for the determination of system stability, respon- siveness, and sensitivity to disturbances, parameter variations, and target attitude motion.},
