abstract = {A general procedure for the design and analysis of three-axis, large-angle attitude control systems has been developed. Properties of three-dimensional rotations are used to formulate a model of such systems. The model is general in that it is based on those properties which are common to all attitude control systems, rather than on special properties of particular components. Numerical values are assigned to attitude error by means of error functions. These functions are used to construct asymptotically stable control laws. The overall (global) behavior of the system is characterized by the envelope of all time histories of attitude error generated by every possible combination of initial condition, target attitude motion, and disturbance. A method for computing upper bounds on the response envelope is presented. Applications of this method indicate that it provides a useful alternative to Liapunov analysis for the determination of system stability, respon- siveness, and sensitivity to disturbances, parameter variations, and target attitude motion.},

@article{Bolund2007,
abstract = {For ages flywheels have been used to achieve smooth operation of machines. The early models where purely mechanical consisting of only a stone wheel attached to an axle. Nowadays flywheels are complex constructions where energy is stored mechanically and transferred to and from the flywheel by an integrated motor/generator. The stone wheel has been replaced by a steel or composite rotor and magnetic bearings have been introduced. Today flywheels are used as supplementary UPS storage at several industries world over. Future applications span a wide range including electric vehicles, intermediate storage for renewable energy generation and direct grid applications from power quality issues to offering an alternative to strengthening transmission. One of the key issues for viable flywheel construction is a high overall efficiency, hence a reduction of the total losses. By increasing the voltage, current losses are decreased and otherwise necessary transformer steps become redundant. So far flywheels over 10kV have not been constructed, mainly due to isolation problems associated with high voltage, but also because of limitations in the power electronics. Recent progress in semi-conductor technology enables faster switching and lower costs. The predominant part of prior studies have been directed towards optimising mechanical issues whereas the electro technical part now seem to show great potential for improvement. An overview of flywheel technology and previous projects are presented and moreover a 200kW flywheel using high voltage technology is simulated.},

abstract = {This paper describes the present status of flywheel energy storage technology, or mechanical batteries, and discusses realistic future projections that are possible based on stronger composite materials and advancing technology. The origins and use of flywheel technology for mechanical energy storage began several hundred years ago and was developed throughout the Industrial Revolution. One of the first “modern” dissertations on the theoretical stress limitations of rotational disks (isotropic only) is the seminal work by Dr. A. Stodola [l] whose first translation to English was made in 1917. The next big milestones were during the 1960s and 1970s when NASA sponsored programs proposed energy storage flywheels as possible primary sources for space missions. However, it was not until the 1980’s when microelectronics, magnetic bearing systems and high power density motor-generators became enabling technologies. The next decade proved that a mechanical battery could surpass chemical batteries for many applications.},
